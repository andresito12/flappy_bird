## Flappy Bird
Flappy Bird is a simple game yet frustrating and addicting game. It consists of a birds that the player can flap through pipes to score points. It looks easy, but it takes focus and practice to get used to the tendencies of the bird.

## Motivation
I wanted to make a game that was simple, yet still a challenge with my current programming abilities. I was a Flappy Bird fanatic when it first became popular years ago. I wanted to see how closely I could recreate it.

## Tech/framework used


<b>Built with</b>
- C++
- [OpenFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc/)
- http://openframeworks.cc/documentation/graphics/ofImage/
- http://openframeworks.cc/documentation/sound/ofSoundPlayer/
- http://openframeworks.cc/documentation/graphics/ofTrueTypeFont/

## Installation
1) Install Visual Studio
2) Download OpenFrameworks
3) Create OpenFrameworks project in C++
4) Clone this reposity

## How to use?
This is a simple implementation of Flappy Bird. There is plenty of room for experimentation. If you would like to add more images or sound effects, make sure you use .wav audio files and .jpg or .png files for images. The ofSoundPlayer library is used to play sound effects. The ofImage library is used to display images. The ofTrueTypeFont is used to load a font into the game to keep track of score. Any font or variations of birds, sound effects, or fonts could be added using these libraries.

## Contribute
Things that could be added:
1) high score tracker
2) different difficulty settings
3) randomly spawn a different color bird like in the original
4) use something other than green rectangles to draw pipes and appear nicer
